# Connect to PostgreSQL from Cloudflare Pages using Remix and Prisma

This is the PostgreSQL version of the [sample code](https://github.com/chimame/connect-remix-and-prisma-d1-using-rpc-on-cloudflare-pages) we created previously to connect to D1 using Prisma.

As with the previous code, Prisma and Remix are separated into separate Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Pages, so it can be used with a free account.
